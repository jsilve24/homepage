## Areas of Focus

If it involves cool math and is impactful, I am interested. Lately my research has focused on uncertainty quantification in the setting of partial identifiability with a particular application to the analysis of multivariate sequence count data (e.g., Microbiome and Gene Expression studies). I also have particular interest in multivariate time-series analysis which I have applied to a wide variety of problems in finance, epidemiology, and personalized medicine. 


#### Applications
- Analysis of Bio-molecular Assays 
  - Microbiome Amplicon and Shotgun Sequencing
  - Bulk and Single-Cell RNA-Seq
  - Phosphoproteomics 
- Inference and Prediction from Financial Time-Series and Alternative Data
- Personalized Medicine
  - Medical Decision Making Under Uncertainty 
  - Personalized Risk Prediction 
- Non-Specific Surveillance in Epidemiology
  - Waste-Water Based Viral Surveillance for COVID-19
  - Use of Syndromic Markers for Assessing Disease Burden
- Agriculture
  - Microbial determinants of feed conversion and disease prevention in livestock

#### Methodological 
- Partial Identified Models
- Bayesian Statistics
- Bayesian Decision Theory 
- Compositional Data
- Multivariate Analysis 
- Uncertainty Quantification in Time-Series Analysis

## Miscellanea 

In my free time I enjoy exploring the outdoors (backpacking, canoing, rock climbing), creating puzzles, and farming.
