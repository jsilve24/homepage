My research focuses on uncertainty quantification in the setting of partial identifiability with a particular application to the analysis of multivariate sequence count data (e.g., Microbiome and Gene Expression studies). I also have particular interest in multivariate time-series analysis which I have applied to a wide variety of problems in finance, epidemiology, and personalized medicine. 

In his free time Justin enjoys exploring the outdoors (backpacking, canoing, rock climbing), creating puzzles, or simply relaxing by Jordan Lake with his wife (Rachel) and their dog (Gauss). Justin and Rachel also maintain a blog [statsathome.com](http://statsathome.com).
